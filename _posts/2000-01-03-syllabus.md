## Labs (15%) - Rooms: D5-004, D5-005 & D5-007
The course will contain guided hands on lab that will lead the students in their first steps in deep learning frameworks. 

## Project (40%) - Rooms: D5-004, D5-005 & D5-007

Students will work in teams to develop a machine learning research project that will be presented both in an oral presentation and as a poster during the final session open to the general public.
