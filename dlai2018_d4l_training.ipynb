For instance, it is possible that your model could end up merely memorizing a mapping between your training samples and their targets -- which would be completely useless for the task of predicting targets for data never seen before.

That's what you would expect when running gradient descent optimization -- the quantity you are trying to minimize should get lower with every iteration. But that isn't the case for the validation loss and accuracy: they seem to peak at the fourth epoch. This is an example of what we were warning against earlier: a model that performs better on the training data isn't necessarily a model that will do better on data it has never seen before. In precise terms, what you are seeing is \"overfitting\": after the second epoch, we are over-optimizing on the training data, and we ended up learning representations that are specific to the training data and do not generalize to data outside of the training set.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, to prevent overfitting, we could simply stop training after three epochs. In general, there is a range of techniques you can leverage to mitigate overfitting."
